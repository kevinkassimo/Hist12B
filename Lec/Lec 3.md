# US inequality 1890s
+ 1890, the richest 1\% received as much income as the bottom half of the population combined; they owned more property than the remaining 99\%
+ Profiteering during Civil War
  + (war is kind of a profit machine)
  + (and the postwar rebuilding)
+ Technological advances: steel production and shipping
+ Industrial mining and wealth of natural resources
+ Growth of railroads -- key to capitalist expansion and transformation of agriculture
  + (easily move coal and steel, timber...)
  + (development of oil, etc.)
+ Rising cost of freight, dispossession of small farmers, availability of cheap labor, irrigation contribute to large-scale, industrial farms.
  + (go into debt simply even need to pay for the freight)
  + (small farmers driven out of their land, while large farms with waged laborers)
+ (continued subsidy of large corporations, free land, and policies for cheap labor)
+ Land speculation (increased land prices/value)
  + (from indigenous people)
  + (originally kept by treaties to the Native Americans)
  + (instead the companies are just kept and waiting for the rise of land price)

# Inequality
+ Monopoly (corporate concentration)
  + Vertical integration (corporate ownership of entire production and distribution process, from raw materials, manufactured good, advertising, and transport)
  + Horizontal integration (buying up or taking control of competing companies)
    + (allow concentration of wealth)
    + (corporations want to avoid competitions)
    + (disconnect between the theory of neo-liberalism and the actual development of capitalism)
+ Cheap Labor -- immigrants, children, and 'racialized' labor
  + (1860 - 1910, US intake large amount of immigrants)
+ Growth of impoverished working-class, rising inequality, consolidation modern racial regime (Jim Crow; Reservation system, etc.) generated renewed debates over *the nature of democracy, power, and the role of government in trying to fix the problem*
  + ("the great wealth disparity is in opposition of democracy, and you cannot have liberty that benefits the rich and harm the poor")
  + ("any effort to distribute policies through central planning lead to the opposite, which arrest the laws of the market, and it is unequal and is treating people unequally" "giving benefit to losers" "any benefit to losers is treating people unequally")
  + (so there are responses to this: labor creates wealth, socialism, anarchism)

# The Problem of Inequality
+ Wealthy/industrialists: income inequality is inevitable, natural, and evidence of progress (natural and necessary)
  + better knowledge, more business skills
    + why? because others are poor
  + those who work hard succeed, and those who work no hard fail
    + (inheritance...)
+ Relied on evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer
+ The poor lacked character, frugality, thrift, work ethic; hindered by *crippling government aid, irresponsible charity, and trade unions!* (Herbert's View)
+ William Graham Sumner, *What Social Classes Owe Each Other* (1883), Neither the wealth nor the government is responsible for helping the poor. Government exists only to protect "the property of men and the honor of women."
+ Sumner: TWO alternatives: "liberty, inequality, survival of the fittest; NOT liberty, equality, and survival of the unfittest"

# Class War on Democracy
+ "Universal Suffrage" can only mean in plain English, the government of ignorance and vice: -- it means a European, and especially Celtic, proletariat on the Atlantic coast; an African proletariat on the shores of the Gulf, and a Chinese proletariat on the Pacific." Charles Francis Adams, Jr.
+ In the South, implemented grandfather clauses, poll taxes and literacy requirements to disfranchise Black voters
+ Property requirements imposed in municipal elections around the country
+ About a dozen states denied the right to vote to anyone receiving public aid, and four other states excluded residents of poor houses and charitable institutions directly

+ Social Democracy: a movement for welfare states and protect the rights of workers and curb the excesses of the capitalism; progressive taxation (rich pay more, poor pay less)
  + not strong in US, but in Europe

# Origin of Progressivism
+ A response to class conflict and violence due to inequality and the dispossession of the people
+ Progressivism was a response to the crisis of class conflict, inequality, urbanization. Reformers varied, but concerns can be grouped together:
  + Economic inequalities
  + Environmental issues
  + Social welfares
  + Working conditions
  + Rights for women and children  
  + Sexuality and population growth  
  + Vice and crime  
  + Political corruption and limited democracy  

Efficiency -- Managing Labor/Creating Capital
+ Fordism: Henry Ford promoted the assembly line; the creation of cheaper commodities and the stimulation of demand brought about by low prices, advertising and credit
+ Fordism "deskills" labor; generates, greater corporate profits, but also strengthens working class as producers and consumers
  + organized consumers and workers

Government Reforms
+ Progressive philosophy sees government as a protector of individual freedom and expression of the will of the people.
+ Wanted more EFFICIENT democracy
  + eliminate corruption, nepotism, backroom deals;
  + wanted government more responsive to citizenry
+ Notion of efficient govt. informed by social Darwinism -- reformers fear too much immigrant control of local govt.

Election Reform
+ Initiative allowed citizens to introduce legislative proposals at the state or local level through petitions, and via direct ballot.
+ Referendum allows voters to pass judgment on proposed legislation such as on the issuance of bonds to raise capital for public improvements.
+ Recall allowed voters to demand special elections to recall or "un-elect" an official
+ Direct Primaries -- allows the people to vote in primary elections rather than leaving nominations up to party leaders
+ Direct election of Senators -- 17th Amendment, 1913

Wilson and Business Regulations
+ Progressives think the business is very important
+ Thus they pass laws that monitors the business (but actually still highly value business and market)
+ Control industries
+ 1913, Federal Reserve Act.
  + created to ensure a more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system by controlling the value of money. It does this by adjusting interest rates which member banks pay to the Federal Reserve System for funds they use to conduct business;
+ 1913 Federal Trade Commission
+ 1914 Clayton Antitrust Act expanded the scope of the Sherman Antitrust Act
+ The Federal Workingmen's Compensation Act of 1916
+ The Adamson Act of 1916 called for an eight-hour day for railroad workers

+ Development a regulatory government by controlling prices, etc.
+ While maintains the free market
