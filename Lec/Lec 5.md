# Life, Death and Debt in the Global South
(Countries that were not so poor in 1960s became poorer in 1980-90s)

Keynesianism/Macroeconomics
+ Gave governments tools to manage periodic crisis of capital
  + pumping money into the economy (stimulus)
  + practicing government intervention through deficit spending
  + boosting consumption or private investment through tax cuts
+ Main objective of economic planners: __FULL EMPLOYMENT__ (commonly accepted)
  + (focusing on the consumer side)

Bretton Woods System, 1944-1971 (Keynes partially )
+ Established International Monetary Fund (IMF to monitor currency exchange rates; loaned reserve currencies to nations with balance-of-payments deficits
+ "balance-of-payments deficit" = imports (goods, services, investment income, transfers) exceed exports
+ Under Bretton Woods, countries had to maintain reserves in the form of gold or foreign (U.S.) currencies, to support their own currencies. Decline in reserves was considered a balance-of-payments deficit because it threatened the ability of the country to meet its obligations
+ Created the World Bank (original International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) - provided financial assistance for postwar reconstruction and economic development of Global South
+ U.S. dollar became main international currency for global trade; dollar pegged to gold whose price was fixed at $35 an ounce. U.S. Treasury was responsible keeping the price of gold fixed and had to adjust the supply of dollars to maintain confidence in future gold convertibility
  + effectively making dollar the the world currency
  + other countries in debt... had to accept

A Bandung World
+ Postwar moment: Chinese Revolution, Cuban Revolution, Decolonization, Eurocommunism, struggle for peace and a welfare state
+ Working people looked to transform the very state (developed under fascism and colonial domination) into tool for redistribution, justice, worker power, but against militarism.
+ Instead, persistence of extractive industries, suppression of trade unions and democracy in the name of global market integration and free trade.
  + produce debt

Cold War and Globalization
+ After WWII, the U.S. emerges as the preeminent global power; seeks investments, raw materials, new markets, cheap, disciplined labor force.
+ U.S. and corporate interests face two obstacles:
  1. Communism
  2. Non-Aligned Movement. Set out to rebuild their economies on social democratic or socialist lines; resisted transnational corporations and U.S. domination, various efforts to liberalize their economies, etc.

(US interventions, covert or overt)
e.g. Guatemala: Overthrown of President Juan Jacobo Arbenz Guzman
+ Elected 1950, liberal reformist govt.
+ Decree 900 - nationalized idle land for redistribution to peasantry, included land owned by United Fruit Company (U.S. company)
+ Arbenz govt offered UF compnesation of $1,185,000 in govt. bonds, but company insisted on $16 million
+ June 1954, Arbenz govt. overthrown, replaced by a military junta

A New International Economic Order (NIEO) 1974
+ Plan adopted by the UN General Assembly to remake the world economy: to transform the governance of the global economy so that the transnational integration of the developing nations can proceed on a more equitable an just basis.

Global Economic Crisis, 1971-74
+ 1971-73, industrial output dropped 10 percent in the U.S., Europe and Japan
+ U.S. stock market lost half its value, and some major banks failed
+ Recession forced businesses to cut back and lay off workers; this reduced tax revenues at the very moment when social assistance spending was soaring.
  + U.S. trade deficit

Source of Economic Crisis 1970s
+ Trade deficit
  + Import expanded twice the pace
+ Nixon administration has Federal Reserve raise interest rates and contract the money supply - only creates "stagflation"
+ August 1971 - takes U.S. dollar off the gold standard. Results in "floating" value of curency and greater uncertainty (creates insecurity of economy)
+ Prices rise, creating more inflation and expanding recession
+ 1973 OPEC oil embargo, followed by 400\% increase in OPEC oil

Economic Vision of NIEO (1974)
+ (a) an absolute right of states to control the extraction and marketing of their domestic natural resources;
+ (b) the establishment and recognition of state-managed resource cartels to stabilize (and raise) commodity prices
+ (c) the regulation of transnational corporations
+ (d) no-strings-attached technology transfers from north to south
+ (e) the granting of preferential (nonreciprocal) trade preferences to countries in the south
+ (f) selected or targeted debt forgiveness for states in the south owed to the north
  + not against globalization, but to manage global trade for balance

Gangsta! G-7 Resists the NEIO ()
+ Some in the IMF supported a transfer of wealth from North to South, and pro-South strategies
+ G7 formed in 1975 - response to OPEC and NIEO (France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, U.S.A, and in 1976 Canada)
+ Henry Kissinger, et. al., used international aid, debt, and threat of military intervention to force nations in line
+ G7 countries also installed people at IMF and World Bank sympathetic to neoliberalism - Tom  Clausen of BankAmerica who headed World Bank; Michel Camdessus who headed IMF after 1987

Third World Debt Crisis
+ The decade after 1973, Third World debt to global banks quintupled, rising by nearly half a trillion dollars.
+ U.S. Treasury Secy. Paul Volcker raised interest rates leading many governments to default, (Mexico defaulted first 1982), followed within months by Argentina, Poland, Chile, Peru, and Venezuela, etc.
+ Between 1980 and 2002, the developing countries made $4.6 trillion in debt payments. This represents about eight times what they owed at the beginning of this period ($580 billion in 1980s)
+ IMF takes over loans and impose Structural Adjustment Policies
  + devaluing their currency, wage freezes or reductions, allowing creditors to claim actual assets, i.e. ownership of companies or resources in exchange for the money they were owed
  + privatizing public assets (e.g. water, mines, electricity)
  + radical cuts to social service spending
  + removing subsidies on essential commodities (rice, heating oil, bread)
  + opening the economy to foreign ownership, allowing them to take profits out of the country

Green Revolution - Neoliberal Development Strategy
+ Backed by World Bank in the 60s and 70s - industrialization of agriculture by replacing indigenous crops with high-yielding varieties
+ Envisioned as Keynesian development model but quickly devolves into a supplyside technocratic solution to produce more for the market without addressing inequality & unequal distribution
+ Result: deepened inequality, food insecurity, and debt

Consequences:
+ destroyed sustainable, self-sufficient local agriculture
+ Mechanized production resulted in displacement, urban migration, unemployment
+ Favored wealthier farmers who could afford the capital investment required
+ Increased use of chemicals and lack of crop varieties (monocultural production) led to soil desertification and erosion, increasing the occurrence of famines.
+ Multinational chemical corporations Monsanto, Dow and Dupont made enormous profits & increased control over food production in Global South

Free Trade Zones
+ Puerto Rico, first "free trade zone" - Operation Bootstrap
(U.S. used Puerto Rico to test)
