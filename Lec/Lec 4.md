# The Road To Serfdom

Causes of the Great Depression
+ Lack of economic diversification  
  + auto, construction, steel industries (instead of others)
+ Relative overproduction caused by lack of purchasing power
  + lack of such power from workers
  + credit, allow people to buy more, but it max out after some time
  + company making the products are investing warehouses, equipment instead of labor
  + increase their capacity to produce (more, faster), but there is not that much consumers to buy them
  + as the consumers are without enough cash
  + surplus products
  + when the industry declines, their first action is to lay off workers
+ Credit structure
  + small (rural) banks failing because of foreclosures and defaults
  + big banks investing recklessly in the stock market
  + no overarching system of banking regulation
    + only after the New Deal does this change...
+ International Trade lost share of European market; European economies weak
  + some of the nations, e.g. Germany, are suffering financial crisis
+ The international debt structure create by the Versailles Treaty -- devastating impact of German war reparations on European and global economy
  + Other countries were in debt, and they were hoping Germany would pay
  + and the debts are issues by US banks
    + extending loans, gambling on stock market
  + this also triggers the formation of Nazi
+ 1930 Hawley-Smoot Tariff, raising import duties to their highest level in American history, exacerbated already weak international trade
  + causing the Europeans to default the debt from US banks

+ New Deals is thought of similar to some of the aspects in Fascism and Soviet Union

First New Deal -- Objective (this is for saving capitalism)
(Hayek does NOT think this is towards collectivism, but he does NOT think this is a good way)
+ Stabilize Financial Institution
  + Congress passed Emergency Banking Act 1933, authorizing fed to inspect the financial health of banks
  + Glass-Steagall Banking Act of 1933 -- prohibited commercial banks from investment banking; created FDIC
    + people are insured of some part of the saved money
+ Provide Relief and Create Jobs
  + Congress created the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA)
  + Immediate relief, then shift to work relief programs -- mainly public works
  + Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)
    + labor camps
+ Assisted Homeowners and Farmers
  + Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC), stopped foreclosures by refinancing mortgages in danger of default and granting low-interest loans to recover lost Homeowners
  + The Federal Hosing Administration (FHA) -- formed out of HOLC to improve housing standards and conditions, and insure mortgages
  + The Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) raised from farm prices through subsidies and by limiting production
    + destroying crops to maintain the prices of farm products
+ Regulated Economy and Strengthened Organized Labor
  + Congress passed the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) and established the National Recovery Administration (NRA), to balance the unstable economy through planning.
  + The NRA established codes for fair business practices: regulated wages, working conditions, production, and prices, set a minimum wage; and recognized the right of workers to organize and engage in collective bargaining [Section 7a].
    + does not admire collectivism, but it works under the condition
    + recognize workers, establish unions
    + concessions to workers
(These are more for corporations to police themselves instead of for the labors. Pro-business)
(In Second New Deal, FDR is more critical as it established the social welfare systems)

Limits and Long-term Impact of the New Deal
+ Strengthens workers rights and collective bargaining; made possible creation of a viable industrial union movement.
+ Contributed to regional development in the West and, to a lesser degree, the South
+ Increased the regulatory functions of the federal government in ways that helped stabilize previously troubled areas of the economy
+ Created the basis of the modern federal welfare state, through its many relief programs and above all through the Social Security system (actually kind of conservative when compared to acts of other countries such as Italy, also without medicare, and considering gender related...)
(These ideas is mainly based on Keynesian Logic, and such logic became dominant after WWII)

War Transforms US Economy
+ Federal budget increased from $9 billion in 1939 to $100 billion in 1945
+ Gross national product soared from $91 billion in 1939 to $214 billion by the end of the war
+ The basic standard of living rose by 15\%. Savings increased due to lack of consumer goods (as more products were ammunitions, and taxes increases)
+ Substantial federal tax increases
+ War-time boom benefited big business: received tax breaks, low interest loans, and contracts that guaranteed profits. Most federal spending went to the largest corporations, further strengthening corporate monopolies
+ Organized labor had to settle for wage freezes imposed by the federal govt., as well as a no-strike pledge
  + Strikes came from 1945, 1946, etc (finally to improve their own conditions)

Origins of Cold War
+ U.S. strategic interests:
  + Access to emerging markets/emphasized free trade
  + spread of "democracy" (free market capitalism)
  + promoted regimes friendly to U.S. interests.
+ Marshall Plan (1947)
  + 13 billion investment over 4 years
  + regenerate markets for US goods
  + fight Communism
+ National Security Act (1947)
  + Reorganizes and expands military
  + basis of Truman doctrines
    + police the world against Communism
  + Beginning of the national security state (mentioned in the basis of Neo-liberalism)
+ Defense spending jumps from 5\% of GDP to 18\% of GDP; shifts from 1/3rd of the federal budgets to 2/3rds.
  (anti-communisms also shakes the national policies, to shake up the labor legislations established in the New Deal)
+ Taft-Hartley Act (1947)
  + restricted workers right to strike
  + outlawed secondary boycotts (by unions)
  + outlawed sympathy strikes \&  'wildcat strikes'
  + restricted freedom of speech
  + required loyalty oaths
  + prevented unions from contributing to political campaigns
  (spawns the neo-liberalism think-tanks)
  (the planned economy is actually at its height during the WWII)
  (this actually benefits corporations)
  (why neo-liberalism not before 1947? This is the reason)

Truman's "Fair Deal"
+ 1945 -- twenty-one-point domestic program:
  + expansion of Social Security
  + Raise the legal minimum wage from 40 to 65 cents an hour
  + ensure full employment through aggressive use of federal spending and investment
  + a permanent Fair Employment Practices Act
  + public housing and slum clearance
  + long-range environmental and public works planning
  + national health insurance [failed]
  (defeated temporarily in 1946 -- Republicans are free traders, and they controlled both houses. The congress refused to pay for education, ... came back in 1948)
  (inflation)

Friedrich Hayek's *The Road to Serfdom*
+ Free markets preserve individual liberty; state's role to guarantee a basic "negative" freedom (a freedom from restraints, in opposition to "positive" freedom)
+ Inequality is a given; to try to create equality by redistribution can lead to manipulation by a despot or a government. Also means treating individuals unequally to create equality
+ Creating equality is not only a disincentive to personal initiative, but actually morally debilitating. (instead of letting them to invest their whole heart into working)
+ Social mobility is possible under free market for those willing to work. (this part is completely ignored by many neo-liberalism, as neoliberalism is for deregulation to create monopoly) (Hayek still prefers some kind of worker rights, and regulations on pollutions)
+ Govt. may legitimately

Some critiques of Hayek
+ Doesn't grasp that human beings can exist both as individuals and as members of a society, without subordinating their needs to planning
+ Rejects the very concept of social justice since there is not way to put an objective value on a grievance or to weigh it against other claims. (Hayek value laws more, but is law just?)
+ Conflates government spending with government planning. History shows that an expansion of the welfare state does not automatically curtail liberty and freedom
+ Note that the countries Hayek studies in which totalitarianism flourished were all countries in which there had never been a culture/tradition of liberal democracy. Germany almost with the short-lived Weimar republic
+ Cannot see the classes, races and other social structures
