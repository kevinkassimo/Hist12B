Free Trade Zones (Puerto Rico)
+ Operation Bootstrap - converted into an export-processing zone - assembled finished manufactured products for U.S. firms
+ Strong labor movement and U.S. minimum wage laws drove capital to Mexico, Dominican Republic and else where for cheaper labor
+ Exception: chemicals, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and scientific equipment (Section 936 exemption provided loophole to U.S. firms. Low production costs and high R&D. Used low wage local labor and moved headquarters, patents and trademarks, PR and shielded all revenue from federal taxes)
+ 1976, PR leader in U.S. investment in the hemisphere; 1992, number one source of profit for U.S. companies in the entire world
+ Section 939 repealed 2005, but permitted controlled foreign corporation (CFC) to only pay federal taxes on income brought back to the United States

Free Trade Zones (Mexico)
+ Border Industrialization Program (BIP) in Northern Mexico (1965)
+ BIP responsible for the first wave of maquiladoras - raw materials and components are imported into Mexico duty free, processed and assembled by Mexican labor, and then exported to markets in developed countries.
+ Free Trade Zones attractive because lack of regulations
+ BIP was sold as a way to generate jobs and increase trade, but reduced wages
+ created industrial slums
+ Promoted capital flight from the U.S.
+ generated MORE illegal immigration across the border
+ Caribbean Basin Initiative (1984) -  Congressional aid to countries that established free trade zones. Turned region into sweatshops for U.S. garment industry; average hourly wages as low as 45 cents for El Salvador, 39 cents for Honduras; 26 cents for Costa Rica, and 62 cents for Guatemala

### Monetarism and the Neoliberal Breakthrough
(Not just Keynesian vs Neoliberal, but there is also another trend of Social Democracies)
(Keynesian more focused on Demand, while Neoliberal focused on Supply)

Milton Friedman and Monetarism
+ Monetarism: an economic theory that focuses on the macroeconomic effects of money supply. Friedman argued excessive expansion of the money supply is inflationary; advocated monetary policy that maintained price stability
+ Friedman advocated for a tight monetary policy to keep inflation under control; argued for a floating currency exchange system in which the market determines currency values
  + against the Bretton Woods agreement
+ He and others broke from full employment - recognized that monetarism may result in higher unemployment
  + He does not have the intention to create income discrepancy

Vietnam and Economic Crisis, 1965-
+ War drained about 9.5\% of the GDP
+ We were spending "$500,000 to kill each enemy soldier, while we spend only 53 dollars for each person classified as poor." Dr Martin Luther King
+ Rising national debt, the balance of payments deficits, etc, led to a speculative run on gold, foreigners sell dollars for gold. Tax increases fail.
+ By 1971, at least 300 billion dollars were overseas.
+ Nixon administration tried to curb inflation by imposing wage and price freezes, and having the Federal Reserve raise interest rates and shrink the money supply, but rather than slow inflation, just slowed the economy "Stagflation"
+ With the election coming up, Nixon reversed course: dropped interest rates and increased govt. spending - result was the largest budget deficit since WWII
+ August 1971 - cut ...

Global Economic Crisis, 1971-74
+ Recession forced businesses to cut back and lay off workers; this reduced tax revenues at the very moment when social assistance spending was soaring
+ Volatile exchange rates encouraged speculators to turn currency trading into a market activity - soon became the world's largest market
+ Finanialization: the new volatility (currencies & interest rates) affected commodity prices (oil, gold, etc.); investors "bet" on future assets; finance begins to overtake manufacturing
+ Floating exchange rates freed governments to increase their money supply to stimulate their economies; U.S. increased its supply by 40% by 1973; British by 70%
+ Global Recession

Impact on Working Class
+ Relative wages decline (prices rise higher than wages)
+ Unemployment in U.S. nearly doubled from 1973 to 1975, to 8.5 percent, rising again to 9.5 percent in 1982
+ Workers responded with a wave of strikes. Neoliberals saw labor as a problem and tried to weaken unions and encouraged capital flight (instead of partners in Keynesian view)
+ 1970s wave of "deindustrialization"/capital flight
  + 1973 - 1980, at least four million jobs lost to firms moving outside the U.S.
  + During decade of 1970s, some 32 million jobs lost as a result of shutdown, relocations, and scaling back operations

Neoliberal Democrat: Carter Years (1976 - 1980)
+ Both Carter and Ford reduced taxes, cut spending, and backed austerity measures to pull the country out of recession
+ Under Carter, Congress cut one billion dollars in federal social welfare programs like Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Food Stamps, under the guise of cutting fraud and abuse
+ Carter reduced taxes on the wealth: 44 percent of the benefit went to the top 5\% of all taxpayers
+ Carter also launched the first significant efforts at deregulation of the airline industry, of transportation, and of parts of the financial sector.

Paul Volcker Shock Therapy
+ Attacked inflation by severely contracting the money supply and raising interest rates from 10\% to 20\% by 1981
+ Tighter credit reduced consumer spending; fewer mortgages, car loans, etc.
+ Corporations cut back on investment
+ Firms in debt went under, leading to massive unemployment
+ Manufacturing output fell
+ Unemployment rate rose to above 11\% for the first time in 40 years

Tax Revolt
+ Jarvis-Gann initiative or Proposition 13. Voted in 1978, won by 2-1 margin
+ Reduced property tax rate by 80\%, state's property tax revenue dropped from 12 billion dollars to 5 billion (57\% reduction in single year)
+ Rise in home prices: 1973 -$1000 lower than national average; 1979 $42,400 higher; 1988 $143,000 higher
+ Loss of revenue led to cuts in basic services -- police, fire, hospitals, clinics/healthcare programs; water, street maintenance, sewer, libraries and various social services
+ With the tax revolt and anti-immigrant sentiment, Californians begin voting DOWN bond initiative to support public schools
+ 1994, California ranked 42nd out of 50 states in spending on education per pupil; 4th graders tied LOUISIANA for last place in standardized test scores

Lobbyists and the Politics of Business
+ Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, Business Roundtable, etc, and think-tanks (American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation) push for neoliberal policy prescription in Washington, D.C.
+ 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act, authorized political action committees (PACs); by 1978, over 800 corporate PACs operating
+ Succeeded in defeating legislation supporting union rights and regulation (environment, consumer protection, occupational safety)
+ Banks succeed in repealing limits on credit card interest
+ Savings and Loan deregulation allow for more financial instruments and riskier investmentsL
  + money market accounts
  + Loan beyond the residential mortgages markets
