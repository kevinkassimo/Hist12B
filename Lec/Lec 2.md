### Liberalism
__Liberalism:__
+ Principles
  + freedom of thought \& freedom of speech
  + consent by the governed as a condition of legitimacy of political powers
  + LIMITED government
  + the application of the rule of law
  + a market economy (__fundamental__ element)
    + involve commodities, labor, etc.
  + a transparent and democratic system of government

(it is WRONG to make the claim that enlightment == liberalism, but liberalism is derived from enlightment)

__Classical Liberalism__
+ emphasized individual rights
+ maintains only real freedom is __freedom from coercion__
+ state intervention in the economy regarded as coercive power that restrict __individual economic freedom__
  + state intervention as violation
+ laissez-faire economic policy (minimal economic intervention and taxation by the state beyond what is necessary to maintain individual liberty, peace, security and __property rights__)
+ 19th century: emphasized *free trade* and *limited government*

(Unacknowledged) foundations of modern liberalism
+ Based on a definition of liberty that places property before human freedom
+ an __exclusionary definition__ of the human that permits various forms of unfree labor, dispossession, and subordination based on "race" and "gender"  
(nearly all founders of liberalism does NOT see slavery as contrary to liberty)

+ "Savages and barbarians" incapable of self-govt; not only justified enslavement, dispossession and colonialism but obscured the violence of dispossession
+ Move from the "state of nature" to political society is justified by the need to contain the natural condition of war in order to preserve/protect human life and property interests
+ Liberal government secures peace and security by transferring the violence of the state of nature to the political state; Africans, Asians, Indigenous people, in some cases event the Irish, excluded from "civil society"

Commons:
+ rights of common land against dispossession
+ ongoing
+ law should be protecting humans, instead of properties

Origins of Magna Carta:
+ drafted in 1215, by rebellious English Barons angry with King John, whose reign was disastrous
+ King John had been excommunicated by the Pope; lost Normanday -- war was expensive, plus launched Crusades to win back support from the Pope. Crown needed money
+ He raised the "scutage" on the Barons
+ Sold women; took children hostage for ransom
+ He seized more of the forest that was held in common

Magna Carta
+ Chapter 38: No bailiff for the future shall upon his own unsupported complaint, put anyone to his "law", without credible witnesses brought for this purposes
+ Chapter 39: No free man shall be arrested or imprisoned or disseised [dispossessed] or outlawed or exiled or any way victimized, neither will we attack him of send anyone to attack him, except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land
+ Chapter 40: To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay right of justice.

+ Chapter 7-8: related to women's rights in marriage
+ Chapter 47: All forests that have been made forest in our time shall be immediately disafforested; and so be it done with river banks that have been made preserves by us in our time
+ Chapter 48: All evil customs connected with forests and warrens, foresters and warrens, immediately be inquired into each county... and within forty days of the completion of the inquiry shall be utterly abolished by the so as never to be restored (implying the common rights of the forests)

1640 - 1848
+ Magna Carta returns during the English Revolution in 1640s. Rural commoners begin seizing timber and other resources on estates. But retrenchment of status quo, restoration of monarchy, and enclosure suppresses common rights granted in Magna Carta
+ Enclosures fenced off the lands thereby removing the rights of commoners to access resources. Led to migration, the growth of cities, industrial agriculture, the degradation of land and resources, and creation of proletariat
  + we witness expropriation (creating landless working class)
+ Revolutionary groups like the Diggers and the Levellers opposed enclosure; invoked Magna Carta to press their rights

Tri-continental Dispossesion:
+ many settlers are also dispossessed themselves
+ Africans
+ Indians (Native)

John Locke
+ Personal assistant to Earl of Shatbury and assisted him in framing the Constitution for Carolina
+ Secretary to the Council of Trade and Plantations. Authored Two Treatises of Government (founding text of liberalism)
+ Condemns absolute power, slavery, supporting the ideas of resisting government. Strong advocate for enclosure; suggested private ownership of property, in lieu of commons is necessary for progress
+ Locke thinks that labor transforms nature to property. Self-ownership: if a man owns himself, he works on the land, and the land is his. Common consent is NOT required.

Locke justifies slavery/dispossession
+ Two Treatises of Government condemns the principle of slavery while justifying African and Indian slavery
  + Only talking about slaves in biblical sense
+ Locke: in a political society, it is liberal citizen's right "to destroy a Man who makes War upon him" (i.e., indigenous people! He thinks that the companies are making the land productive)
+ Locke: "captives taken in a just war" had "forfeited their lives and, with it, their liberties". Captives in a "just war" were thus slaves "subjected to the absolute dominion and arbitrary power of their masters"
+ Fundamental Constitution of South Carolina: "Every freeman of Carolina shall have absolute power and authority over his negro slaves, of what opinion of religion soever"
  + in Locke's sense, "productiveness" means turn to commodities

Locke, Indians and the Commons
+ Argued that unproductive land has no value; uses the term "lie in waste" interchangeably with "lie in common" to describe unproductive use of the land
+ Lockean notions of progress = capitalist exploitation of the land, privatization, and enclosure. He feared that if you let the Indians have the land "we should see him give up again to the wild common of nature"
  + implying other English opposition of enclosure
+ feared that "commoning" might result from the alliances of indentured whites, Africans, and Indians
  + He fear the alternative to the Chartered Companies' Production

John Stuart Mill and Colonial Racism
+ Published On Liberty argued for small government as protection of individual rights
+ Agent of colonialism: employed by British East India Company
+ In On Liberty, he defended Imperialism by arguing that a fundamental distinction existed between civilized and barbarous peoples

+ Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end. Liberty, as a principle, has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion
+ ...savage tribes so averse from regular industry, that industrial life is scarcely able to introduce itself among them until they are ... conquered and made slave of
  + "benefit of slavery": bring to the level of European, as if "slavery is education"
  + "who is deserved of liberty or not"

+ Slavery => Contracted (Coerced) Labor
