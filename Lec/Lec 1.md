King: US on the wrong side of revolution

Thing-oriented => Person-oriented

market principals and corporate models should govern all social life
=> antithetical to democracy

Flint river, lead poisoning.
EFM took over the government



Emergency Managers: Assault on Democrary

Michigan Public Act 4 (2011), granted powers to unelected managers to fire elected officials, abrogate labor contracts, sell off public assets and impose new taxes on residents -- all without a single vote from anyone

Emergency managers: at least 5 years of management experience, ...
2 day orientation to take over the job

African American is specially suffered under this event
In Michigan about 49% of the African American population has no locally elected government & under emergency managers. They only make up 14% of the state's population

Michigan Welfare Rights Organization, Blue Planet Project, & other orgs. -- appeal ed to United Nations that water is a human right, and shutting off water to those unable to pay is a human rights violation


How did Detroit and Flint became poor?

Flint in 1960: one of the highest per capita in the US. GM was the main employer, and once the Union is very well organized.

First priniciple of neo-liberalism: maximum profit by driving down the labor cost.
(find cheapest person to hire, while having the Union is obstructing this...)
Outsourcing, moving the factory to somewhere else with less cost
Unprotected labor (undocumented immigrants)


Decline:
+ Outsourcing GM production to US South and Global South -- incentivized by free trade policies, cheaper labor, fewer regulations (countries in debt, which allow remove laws of protection of vulnerable labor)
+ Flint offeres tax cuts and other incentives to keep GM but outsourcing continues. Challenged by competition from Japan & Germany, Black labor militancy, and economic crisis of 1970s (deregulate)
+ Betwen 1979 and 2010, FLint loses 87.5 percent of its manufacturing jobs.
+ GM turns to finance: insurance, banking services, mortgages, home equity loans (in 1999, involved subprime mortgages, sold to people with low credit... which led to the bankruptcy of GM itself)


Domino Effect: Deepening Flint's Crisis
+ Predatory lending and collapse of housing market devastated economy
+ Lost tax revenue deepened city's deby. Flint leaders turned to neoliberal policies of privatizing public assets in order to attract investment capital: selling ublic lands, raising water rates and privatizing water (tax cut on companies that are fleeing Flint...)
+ Downtown redevelopment schemes backed by [ublic funds and more tax breaks

(push Detroit to bankruptcy so that they could grab the Detroit river to private)


What is Neoliberalism?
+ A set of economic and social theories that free markets and free trades and reduced regulations, or no regulations, and privatization of virtually every sphere of social and economic life, is the best way to structure society.
+ Some roots: libertarianism
+ Based on myths that the world of simply sellers and buyers
+ Promoted myths: never imagine the government plays a large role 
+ Elimination of government at all
+ Not anti-state but anti-regulation, anti-safety net, anti-protection for vulnerable, but the state is essential in making public lands and resources available for private ownership and investment; for providing infrastructure, a strong military, bailouts resulting from risk


Key features of Neoliberalization
+ Maximize profits by driving down labor costs by outsourcing, exploiting unprotected foreign labor, weakening trade unions, free trade policies.
+ Dismantling the welfare state, deregulation, and eroding government protections for the most vulnerable
+ Revolutionizing monetary and fiscal policies as a means to promote unregulated, free market activity
+ Financialization -- accumulation accrues largely through financial channels rather than trade and commodity production (does NOT mean that financial channel is anti-production... they sometimes work together)
+ Shrinking federal domestic spending & transferring burden of social spending to states and cities
+ Expanding the national security state (e.g. military, also domestic policing, militarizing the border)
+ Dismantling democratic institutions and forms of popular power -- collective bargaining rights, voting rights, etc.
(compare to neo-conservation)
